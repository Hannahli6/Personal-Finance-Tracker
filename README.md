# My Personal Project

## Personal Finance & Expense Tracker 

### Who will use it? 
This application is intended for anyone who wants to keep track of their weekly/monthly expenses and how much money they are saving! **It could be a great tool for budgeting and avoiding the habit of overspending!**

### What will the application do? 
This app will record and categorize expenses into fields like: food, bills, transportation, tution fees etc...
The user is able to add and delete expense entries. Additionally, the app will ask the user to enter their paycheck amount and select a percentage of that amount to put towards saving (where the user can see their saving balance as well). The tracker will finally provide charts / summaries to display the users spending patterns, alerting the user for overspending when exceeding a certain limit.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is of interest to me because I find myself buying a lot of unneeded items and having no accurate awareness of how much I was spending each month, which leads me to saving less money. I wanted to make this app so I can learn Java in the process and see how the final developed application can help my piggy bank!
